What Is a Domain Model?
A domain model is used in software engineering.
It is a common tool for object-oriented programming languages like Java.
It's a representation of the organization's data, independent of the way the data is stored in the database.

A domain model is a structural model of basic domain concepts and the relationships between them.
A domain model may contain domain objects, conceptual classes, associations, or attributes.

Key Terms for Domain Modeling
The domain in a domain model is the collection of all of the objects in that system.
This domain contains all of the data and a representation of how that data behaves and interacts with each other.

A class is any set of objects that behave in the same way or have the same properties.

A conceptual class is a thing, behavior, or object within the domain.

Attributes describe the class. They are the individual pieces of information you want to store about the classes.

Associations record the relationships between the conceptual classes.

How to Build a Domain Model
To construct a domain model, we first identify all our conceptual classes.
Then we add associations between the conceptual models to represent the relationships between them.
We then add the attributes we need to store the information we want to use.
