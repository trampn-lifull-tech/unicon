What Is a Data Model?
A data model is used in database design and development.
It is a common tool for relational database design, the most popular type of database is use today.
Some names of products that use relational databases are Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.

In data models, the collection of all of the objects in that system that contain all of the data,
and a representation of how that data behaves and interacts with each other, is called the schema instead of the domain.

Key Terms for a Data Model
An entity is the basic construct in a data model.
An entity is a person, place, thing, or event that must be represented in the database.
These will become the tables or rows in a database.

Relationships between the entities are modeled next to show which entities will interact with the others.

Attributes are the individual pieces of information you want to store about the entities.
These become the columns in the database.

How to Build a Data Model
To construct a data model we first identify all our entities.
Then we add relationships between the entities to represent which other entities will interact with them.
We then add the attributes we need to store the information we want to use.
